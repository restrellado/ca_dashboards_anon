# Anonymize California School Dashboard Data 

This script is used to anonymize publicly available California School Dashboard data so it can be used in demonstrations, presentations, and blog posts. It removes county, school, and district names. It can also combine 2-3 districts to further anonymize the data. 

All California School Dashboard data can be found [on this website](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/#/Home). Thank you to [DJ Ervin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ervin-dj-723910126/) for the idea.
